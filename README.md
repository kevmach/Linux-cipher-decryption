Exploring Linux commands to decrypt files and reveal hidden messages.

# Decrypting an Encrypted File Using Linux Commands


We will complete a series of tasks to obtain instructions for decrypting an encrypted file. Encryption of data in use, at rest, and in transit is critical to security functions. We'll use Linux commands to uncover the clues needed to decode a classical cipher, restore a file, and reveal a hidden message.


## What Weâ€™ll Do

- List the contents of a directory
- Read the contents of files
- Use Linux commands to revert a classical cipher back to plaintext
- Decrypt an encrypted file and restore the file to its original state

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Linux commands
- A terminal or command-line interface to run the commands
